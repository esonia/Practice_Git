# Practice_Git

This line is added from GUI before cloning to the local folder. Committing changes from GUI
Editing file on main brnach which still has only 1 line. Need to know how to bring the changes from branch1 to main -- There was a conflict with the main branch. Hence commit was not happening. So moved this line from main to bottom and commiting to main branch. Will then see if conflicts still there
